Collaboration and contribution to the FinOps Foundation
---

_We're looking for candidates to become Ambassadors and Community Contributors_.

There’s no way we’ll grow if we don’t welcome the perspective of FinOps practitioners all over the world. Whether you’re a member or not, here are ways to contribute your best practices about cloud finance, cloud cost management, and building a successful FinOps culture.

## How to get involved
Here are a few ways for people to get involved with the FinOps Foundation, aside from becoming a chairperson or holding a leadership role at the organization (though we’re always looking for talented members who want more responsibilities!).

### Become a member and hang out with us on Slack
The easiest thing to do is to sign up to become a FinOps Foundation member. Once you’re accepted, you’ll be invited to [our Slack](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/) where you’ll meet thousands of like-minded individuals who want to learn and do more about FinOps practices and cultures at countless businesses and enterprises.

### Submit a FinOps blog article or best practice write-up to us
Have you published your own FinOps article or guide somewhere and want to share it with our members? Maybe you have a new perspective on FinOps and want to write for us? We’re always looking for new perspectives to highlight from our FinOps community.

### Present best practices or a use case during a member call (members only)
Sign up to be the main speaker or discussion topic leader during our monthly members-only call. For chosen members, the floor is theirs to share best practices and FinOps stories to an audience of practitioners. Hone your speaking skills, share your discoveries, and meet new people by taking part in a member call as an honored guest.

### Inquire to become an Ambassador
FinOps Foundation Ambassadors are members with a deep understanding of the space, plenty of tools to teach both new and existing members new tricks (and contribute regularly to the blog), and have the interest and drive to lead [meetups](https://www.finops.org/meetups) and [digital events](https://www.finops.org/events/). To learn more, become a member and [get in touch](https://www.finops.org/finops-ambassador).

If any of these methods sound interesting, or you have your own FinOps ideas of your own, we’d like to hear them. Get in touch via email or in Slack if you’re already a member. If you aren’t a member yet, [register today](https://www.finops.org/membership/)!
