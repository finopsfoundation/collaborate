## Program description
The FinOps Foundation (F2) supports the worldwide community of the Cloud Financial Management meetups they are listed [here](https://www.meetup.com/pro/finops/).

F2 is currently working on expanding the Cloud Financial Management community around the globe, and we are happy to accept the new meetup communities to join our network, and become one of the official F2 meetups.

If you are interested in joining the list of official F2 meetups, please take a look at ["How to apply?"](#apply) section below.

## Benefits of joining the F2 Meetup Program

* Boosting the visibility of your meetup group
* [Meetup Pro](https://www.meetup.com/lp/meetup-pro) cost coverage
* One free training and certification seat ($890 value) to give away at your first meeting
* One-time complimentary swag certificate to the swag store

## Meetup Best Practices

This page provides guidance on starting a new meetup group based on the experience of existing ones.
Here is a list of suggestions and tips to get you started:

### Naming convention

If you start a brand new meetup that aims to cover the whole FinOps landscape, we recommend to use one of the following naming convention:

* Cloud FinOps <Location>
* Cloud Financial Management <Location>

Please, **do not use any commercial brand or product names in the meetup name**. We recommend that you include the word “Cloud” along with FinOps to improve searchability.

### Create the Meetup

The description of the group is left to the discretion of the organizers.

A brief description of the role of the F2 and the Cloud Financial Management approach could be added or borrowed from one of the other [official meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/finops/).

You can use text from the [FinOps Definition](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/definition).

In order for your meetup to be as visible as possible you should add a relevant list of tags.
(For example, "FinOps", "DevOps", "Cloud Financial Management", "AWS", "Azure", "GCP", “Cloud”, “Cloud Native” etc.)

The most important thing is to keep an active group, with frequent events (ideally once a month but no less than once per quarter).

Sustaining a group yourself can be difficult to manage. Ideally you should have a team of passionate and committed co-organizers. We recommend 2 or 3 total co-organizers.

Joining forces helps spread the load and expands the network.

### Find speakers for your Meetup

You should provide some kind of form in order to allow people to submit their talk proposal similar to this:

*** TBD *** (need FinOps Foundation version)

When possible take care to review their presentations ahead of events. Also, attend conferences where you can find speakers and meet a lot of people who use or are involved in the F2 projects that may be interested in joining your group.

An additional source of potential speakers could be other FinOps Foundation Ambassadors. Reach out to them via Slack for more information.

### Find sponsors/place

**NOTE: COVID-19 UPDATE FOR 2020-- Digital events are a viable option to encourage safe, distanced participation.**

If you're in an area where it's safe to do so, try contacting local technology companies for ideas of how to hold events. Many of them are interested in hosting such kind of events (though COVID-19 might have changed event policies for many companies).

It's better to find a place in a central location. Downtown or City Centres would be ideal because it's easier to access for most of attendees ( of course, with COVID-19 limitations and safety regulations in mind).

### Schedule a new event

First of all don't forget to thank your sponsors.

Then the most important information is about the agenda, each talk description should contains:
* A short bio of the speaker
* An attractive title
* A paragraph describing the content of the presentation/demo

If you're planning a hands-on demo, you should ensure that the WiFi can handle the number of attendees. NOTE: If running a virtual meetup, remind attendees to stop additional services or background work to ensure there's enough bandwidth for accessing and viewing demos.

Furthermore you should check you're not limited by some kind of quotas (Cloud provider).
The choice of date and time matters. Most of meetups choose Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after working hours.

### Post event
If possible you should record videos or screencaptures of the presentations and take pictures for social media and the event page to share afterwards. We recommend sharing the slides with all members after the event. Optionally, please submit them as Pull Requests to the [F2 Collaborate repo](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/collaborate) on GitHub.

### F2 swag
If you're a newly created meetup and added to meetups.cncf.io, please reach out to membership@finops.org for a complimentary $50 swag certificate to the F2 Store.

### Ask for help
If you have any other questions, you can ask them in the [F2 Slack](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/).

## FAQ
### How often are Meetup applications reviewed?
We review the Meetup applications on a monthly basis, and if your Meetup group satisfies our requirements and best practices, we'll send you an invitation.

### Do I need to re-apply?
No, once you formally apply you are part of the pool of applicants that get reviewed on a monthly basis.

### Will you email me with a status update of my application each month?

No. We will only follow up if your application is accepted.
Please, ensure that your group satisfies our mandatory requirements (eg. three and more successful meetups, naming guidelines, etc.) before applying!
### Does F2 offer the promotional support for the Meetup groups?

It's the sole responsibility of the Meetup group to self-promote itself, however F2 is happy to offer the marketing support for the Meetup group as one-off in some exceptional cases (eg. the Meetup group is affiliated with the larger local Cloud Financial Management event happening the same time in the same area).

Also, please make sure that you are aware of other community-focused F2 programs, including F2 Ambassadors and F2 Speakers Bureau.

### I'd like to get in touch with the F2 ambassador in a specific city/region. Where can I find who is a local ambassador?

Here is a map of the F2 Ambassadors (TBD).

**NOTE:** If you are an existing F2 Ambassador and would like to adjust your location on the map, please contact the F2 Staff.
