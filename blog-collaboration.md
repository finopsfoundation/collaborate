# Blog contribution guidelines and template

![Collaborate and contribute as an Ambassador or Community member to F2](/img/finops-foundation.png)

Thanks for your interest in contributing a blog post to the FinOps Foundation. Here’s an overview of submission guidelines and an example post.

High-level rules:
Guest contributions are strictly for sharing FinOps best practices, how-tos
Screen shots, case studies, and stories should be anonymized to industry/regions and not specific naming
Focus on teaching and not telling or selling
No pitches or links to signing up for services, but links to open source materials are OK (repos, codepen snippets, tech demos of open source solutions)


## Post title
Introduction statement, typically two sentences long. These are styled differently in the blog as a lead-in to the rest of the post content.

Main paragraph about what your post is about and what you will cover. Sometimes it’s appropriate to include a list to help organize multiple things:
* Cloud financial management sub topic 1
* Cloud financial management sub topic 2
* Cloud financial management sub topic 3

### More context as sub-section of intro
Before diving into the main contents, it’s also nice to use a sub-section in this introduction area to provide more context to the reader.

## Cloud financial management sub topics
Shift into covering each sub topic here. Try not to start a section with an image as our styleguide supports images between text. If there are sub-sections to add context, feel free to use additional sub-headers to keep information organized.

Embedding content from other sources is fine, so long as it supports the best practice or concept being talked about and is not a plug (e.g. educational YouTube videos, slideshare, etc.).

## Overview of ideas

Go over all the new ideas and concepts shown in this section. You can write paragraphs about these takewaways, or even use a list. It's up to you.

## Closing statement
After covering all material, please leave the reader with a closing statement. Change their mind, as them to start dialog, or have them try new code snippets or policy. Be welcoming, be warm.

## (**REQUIRED**) Ask them to reach out to you on Slack
We welcome inviting readers to further discuss or ask questions about your topic to you on the FinOps Foundation Slack.
